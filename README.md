# Sign Language Interpreter

This project utilizes Open-CV and MediaPipe to translate alphabetical sign language to text on a screen with Text-To-Speech playback functionality. When running the [signlanguageinterpreter.py](signlanguageinterpreter.py) script, your left hand is used for controls including playback, confirming letters, backspace, clear, adding a space. These controls can be found in the [Controls](Controls) folder. The right hand is used for spelling letters, the symbols for these letters can be found in the [Letters](Letters) folder. Note that some letter symbols had to be modified from the standard symbols as MediaPipe has a hard time detecting when fingers are crossed.
